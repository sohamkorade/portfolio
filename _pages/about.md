Hello! I'm a final-year BTech CSE student at IIIT Hyderabad, passionate about the intersection of technology and research. With a foundation in computer science and engineering, Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from MERN stack applications to ResNets and compilers to computational musicology. I am always eager to learn and explore new ideas, particularly those that bridge technology and and my hobbies: music, chess, languages.
