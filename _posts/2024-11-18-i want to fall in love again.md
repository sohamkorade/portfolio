i want to fall in love again   
to get hurt,  
to split apart and probe  
deep in my heart   
  
it's been too long a break;  
i want to check  
if the cracks have sealed   
and the wounds have healed   
  
i want a change of battery,  
a new replacement,  
for the current one  
deserves no flattery  
  
who's in charge?  
why do they barge?  
should i shoulder or shoulder   
these responsibilities?  
  
what is satisfaction:  
the gelifraction  
or the lack of action?  
  
author my own fate?  
is it too late, au fait,  
to get my priorities straight?
