i wasted time  
shall i get it back  
from my good night's sleep?  
  
i may finish the task  
and earn some pay  
but rob my spark   
the very next day  
  
this song  
won't last too long  
and health will take it's toll  
whom shall i call?   
"a hospital."  
  
i give the money   
to pay the price  
and buy my health back  
just enough to live again  
why this bargain?   
"better learn to prioritize."
