mild rain, teardrops from the sky, silent and dual,  
happy or sad, a paradox  
  
why fear the storm,   
withholding truths to shield from harm?  
  
why fear the clear sky,  
harboring the dark clouds that pass by?  
  
either quench my fire or drench it,  
dont smolder it or let it flicker  
  
i yearn for a downpour  
that washes away my tears,  
or a bright sun  
to turn them into vapors  
  
my clothesline, laden with wet veils,  
no room in my home to dry them inside  
drizzle keeps them wet, prolonging the delay;  
i await the storm to blow them away  
  
yet i trust the rain,  
mild or intense,  
for the petrichor  
blends not two scents
