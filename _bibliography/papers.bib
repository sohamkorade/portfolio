  abstract={The concept of raga in Indian classical music serves as a complex, multifaceted melodic entity that can be approached through various perspectives. Compositions within a raga act as foundational structures, serving as the bedrock for improvisations. Analyzing their textual notations is easier and more objective in comparison with analyzing audio samples. A significant amount of musical insights can be derived from the discrete swara sequences alone. This paper aims to construct an intuitive visualization of raga space, using swara sequences from raga compositions. Notations from public sources are normalized, and their TF-IDF features are projected into a low-dimensional space. This approach allows for qualitative analysis of both Carnatic and Hindustani ragas, mapping them to known raga theory.},

  abstract={Telugu script makes use of an orthographic syllable known as akshara as its basic unit. We have designed a computer program that calculates four different parameters of graphic complexity for Telugu aksharas: Perimetric complexity, number of connected points, number of disconnected points, and number of simple strokes. With the help of an algorithm, we have also calculated orthographic neighbors for 200 words classified as simple, moderately complex, and complex based on their syllable structure and estimated graphic complexity. In this paper, we will present our results pertaining to graphic complexity and its relationship to orthographic neighborhood size.},

  abstract={Indian raga music requires a symbolic notation dataset to support music information retrieval (MIR) tasks. With the growing applications of generative artificial intelligence, text-based datasets can be especially valuable, as these models excel when inputted structured symbolic data. A high-level analysis of ragas is difficult from audio data. In this article, we announce our new dataset called InRaMu. Notations of raga-based compositions in Hindustani, Carnatic and Rabindra Sangeet were scraped from the Internet. The compiled dataset consists of 7 sources combined to get 2,295 compositions in 337 ragas. Total number of compositions, with 976,826 individual notes, correspond to a combined playback duration of about 16,280 minutes. Special care was taken during data preprocessing such as filtering of compositions to ensure raga accuracy. This article provides the overview of dataset format, and provides statistical information, along with potential applications of the dataset.},
